Making semantic content
semantic markup is importent for users who are blind that uses a bot to read the page.

create a header with title, logo and navbar
create a footer with some contact info and copyright
create a few sections (section should start with a h2 tag, ex. contact, about, blogposts.. io group related content)

CONTENT SECTION ELEMENTS
<ARTICLES> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article
Elements that is an standalone article. that can be taken out of context and still make sense based on heading and paragraphs.

the <article> section element - describes self contained pices of content, like blogposts.

<NAV> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav
is used for every major link elements like in the header and footer

<ASIDE> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside
Like sidebar, not directly related to the main content but it holds content that is related to the entire page.
